	<h1>Munroe Score</h1>

	<p>
		This site is based on the <a href="http://xkcd.com/903/" rel="external">XKCD comic</a>,
		designed to put to the test the idea that every Wikipedia article
		eventually leads to <strong>Philosophy</strong>. This is now known as <strong>Munroe's Law</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>Munroe Score</strong> is the number of articles you have to go through
		before reaching <strong>Philosophy</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For more details on this phenomenon, check out this
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy" rel="external">relevant wikipedia page</a>.

	<p>
		<strong>Important:</strong> This site is a work in progress.<br />
		All code is now available on
